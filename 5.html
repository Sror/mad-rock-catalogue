                                    Working off a similar design goal as the Onsight, the Banshee offers the same attributes and all-around performance as the Phoenix, but in a women's specific model. Using female lasts to ensure women a better fit than the unisex last of the Phoenix, the Banshee is also a lace-up to offer another degree of precise control. Round this out with subtle laser-etched graphics and an exclusive color palette to differentiate it from its counterpart, and you have a great all-day shoe with a superlative value-to-performance ratio.
