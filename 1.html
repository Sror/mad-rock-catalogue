            Mad Rock began in 2002 as a small, climber owned and operated company that made innovative, highly technical and affordable rock climbing shoes. After many years and over a million pairs later, we still choose not to reflect on our accomplishments nor rest on our laurels-because our best shoes will always be the next batch! To us, "Innovation" isn't just a catch phrase-it's a challenge to be met daily. In that spirit, we embrace using the latest materials and technology to meet consumer demands while maintaining the high quality and innovative products that have put us on the map and in the packs of climbers around the world!

            Refinement of an existing design can often be as labor intensive as creating an all-new one. Yet instead of making new models for the sake of making new models, for 2013 Mad Rock is committed to making subtle but definite running improvements to our existing shoe models and offering a variety of new features, colors and options to our increasingly popular hardware and accessory lines. Mad Rock's goal from the start has been to offer the most sophisticated designs and materials at a fair price, and now more than ever our message of value, quality, durability and climbing enjoyment rings true - so much so that our competitors are increasingly following our lead. We always thought that climbing should be enjoyed by everybody - and we aim to do that with the best gear at a fair price. For 2013 and beyond, Mad Rock is committed to offering you a great deal on the best equipment and back it up with the best customer service in the business.
